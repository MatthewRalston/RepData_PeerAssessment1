```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
complete_data <- data[complete.cases(data),]
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
totals <- aggregate(data$steps,by=list(data$date),sum)
names(totals)<-c("date","total_steps")
# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
ggplot(totals)+geom_histogram(aes(x=total_steps))+ggtitle("Total Steps Histogram")
# Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
mean(totals[complete.cases(totals),]$total_steps)
median(totals[complete.cases(totals),]$total_steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}

averages<-aggregate(complete_data$steps,by=list(complete_data$interval),mean)
names(averages)<-c("interval","mean_steps")
# Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
ggplot(averages)+geom_line(aes(interval,mean_steps))
# Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
averages[which.max(averages$steps),] 
```

## Imputing missing values
```{r}
# Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
total<-length(data[,1])
nonNA<-length(data[complete.cases(data),1])
total - nonNA
# Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
# Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
for (i in seq(0,2355,5)) {
  interval <- data[data$interval == i,]
  data$steps<-replace(data$steps,is.na(data$steps) & data$interval == i,round(mean(complete.cases(interval$steps))))
}
# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day 
sums<-aggregate(data$steps,by=list(data$date),sum)
names(sums)<-c("date","total_steps")
ggplot(sums)+geom_histogram(aes(total_steps))+ggtitle("Total Steps Histogram Imputed")
# Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
mean(sums$total_steps)
median(sums$total_steps)
```
It is clear that these values differ from the previous section.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r}
# Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
days<-weekdays(as.Date(data$date))
days <- replace(days,days %in% c("Saturday","Sunday"),"weekend")
days <- replace(days,days != "weekend","weekday")
data$is_weekday<-days
# Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).
weekday <- data[data$is_weekday == "weekday",]
weekend <- data[data$is_weekday == "weekend",]
weekday_averages<-aggregate(weekday$steps,by=list(weekday$interval),mean)
names(weekday_averages)<-c("interval","mean_steps")
weekday_averages$is_weekday<-rep("weekday",length(weekday_averages[,1]))
weekend_averages<-aggregate(weekend$steps,by=list(weekend$interval),mean)
names(weekend_averages)<-c("interval","mean_steps")
weekend_averages$is_weekday<-rep("weekend",length(weekend_averages[,1]))
averages <- rbind(weekday_averages,weekend_averages)
ggplot(averages)+geom_line(aes(interval,mean_steps))+facet_grid(is_weekday ~.)
```
